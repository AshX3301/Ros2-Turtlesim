Goal 1: Control turtle
● Spawn a turtle at random locations.
● Make it reach a goal in 2D env by controlling linear and angular velocity.
● Implement a PID controller to ensure the turtlebot reaches the goal as fast as possible without overshooting.
● Show performance variation for various gain values. Figure out the variables/parameters to plot e.g. control inputs, current state etc. to explain
why it work
