## Goal 1: Control turtle
- Spawn a turtle at random locations.
- Make it reach a goal in 2D env by controlling linear and angular velocity.
- Implement a PID controller to ensure the turtlebot reaches the goal as fast as possible without overshooting.
- Show performance variation for various gain values. Figure out the variables/parameters to plot e.g. control inputs, current state etc. to explain why it work
